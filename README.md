## MY FIRST HTML & CSS PROJECT - (in 2019) - IMITATING A WEBSITE PROVIDED AS IMAGES

##### JUNIOR LEVEL PROJECT

- I never touched the project after I finished it because I wanted to see how far I had progressed in comparison to current ones.

- The inspiration for this project came from https://www.frontendmentor.io.

- This project is one of the frontendmentor website's imitation challenges.

#### The challenge's original URL is: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clipboard-landing-page-5cc9bccd6c4c91111378ecb9

**All content(images, texts, icons, and all others) is provided by frontendmentor.**
